## MOOC

I believe that any theoretical knowledge can be learned with the help of books and online resources, as long as you have the self-discipline to study and practice.

I have a growing list of MOOCs and certifications that I have completed. Here they are:

#### From Coursera

 + Materials Data Science and Informatics
 + Machine Learning Specialization
 + Programming Fundamentals
 + Introduction to Engineering Mechanics
 + Deep Learning Specialization
 + IBM AI Engineering
 + AI for everyone

**Tips**: Coursera offers Financial aid.

## Materials Informatics resources
 Check out this blog: [What is Materials Informatics](https://citrine.io/what-is-materials-informatics-blog/).

 If you're interested in delving further into this subject then take a look at this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0SWcFqypCl4lrzk1dMWwTUrzQZFt7y0).; it's regularly updated by Dr. Taylor Sparks

 If you're looking for something more structured, this might be a good option for you [Materials Data Sciences and Informatics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/material-informatics). It is taught by Dr. Surya Kalidindi who also played a critical role in PyMKS I believe. As I mentioned above, you can apply for financial aid.

## CS Fundamentals
I have many friends who majored/are majoring in computer science. After spending a lot of time with them, I have cultivated the impression that you can learn the fundamentals of computer science on your own by reading books and watching videos. There are many truly remarkable resources out there, and I will only share the ones that I have used myself or plan to use in the future.

+ Teach Yourself Computer Science (https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
+ The missing semester of your CS education (https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
+ Ben Eater’s site (https://eater.net/) to get an overall idea about computers work. Dude was on Khan Academy before
+ This one (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming#Completed_2). Bill Gates once said, "If you think you're a really good programmer... read (Knuth's) Art of Computer Programming... You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing," Full disclaimer, I did not read the book yet.
+ I have heard good things about it. [CS 50](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA)
+ Also there is a good crash course available on youtube. It will give you an overall idea of CS. (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=qiCa5yGbUuSX7v1n)
+ [What every computer science major should know ](https://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) by Matt might
+ Also another excellent resource : (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
+ [Another one](https://github.com/tagnja/resources-of-learning/blob/master/%23cs-foundations.md)

Anyway, I will continue to update the list in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.

## Fluid Mechanics
- There is a cool website that you have to see [efluids](https://www.efluids.com/)
- [Lorena Barba's YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lorenabarba/featured). She also has a [blog](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/)
- [ CPPMechEngTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@CPPMechEngTutorials/videos). They also have a great Heat Transfer playlist
- This is a bit cartoonish but it does it's job  [lunchboxsessions](https://www.lunchboxsessions.com/materials/load-sensing-pumps/load-sensing-pumps-lesson)
- [FYFD](https://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/)
- [MIT OCW](https://engineering.purdue.edu/%7Escalo/menu/teaching/me608/ME608_Notes_Murthy.pdf)
- [ Fluid Mechanics 101](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcqQi9LT0ETkRoUu8eYaEkg/videos)
- A great [site](https://www.learncax.com/) to learn CFD concepts.
- This is a [note](https://cfdworld.blogspot.com/2014/02/fluid-mechanics-lectures-notes.html?m=1) has a compilation of CFD Resources
- Another [note](https://engineering.purdue.edu/%7Escalo/menu/teaching/me608/ME608_Notes_Murthy.pdf)
- There is a [Podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9wY3IuYXBwbGUuY29tL2lkMTA5MjQ4NDE4Nw?ep=14). The last episode came out 3 years ago.

During my college years, textbooks were our primary resources for our coursework. To this day, I remain convinced that books provide the most effective means of comprehending a subject thoroughly. I intend to include them very soon.

## Linguistic resources

I would like to make it clear that I don't have any educational background in Linguistic. I am pretty much a dilettante/noob. But I do find Linguistic is a fascinating topic. Here are some of the resources that I was recommended of:

+ (https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/20/index.htm)
+ (https://web.stanford.edu/%7Ejurafsky/slp3/)
+ [Linguistic Fundamental](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIMXVU7SGRJhu62mFhPj5q5CGnvKGYu2&si=I1y5sFGtVWC3OFAO)
+ [r/linguistics wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/index)

## Hardware that I am currently using

#### Laptop


Throughout my undergraduate years, I often found myself borrowing laptops from friends to complete my school assignments. It wasn't until my senior year that I made the decision to purchase a laptop for myself. Unfortunately, the second-hand laptop market in Bangladesh proved to be quite challenging. Thus, I had to thoroughly consider before making the purchase. I will later include a blog post what to look for when you are planning to buy preowned laptops

As of now, I am actively using an MSI MODERN 15 A5M as my daily driver. Initially equipped with 8 GB of RAM, I subsequently upgraded it by adding an additional 8 GB. So far, everything has been running smoothly and efficiently. 8 GB RAM is enough. In retrospect, I should have spent that money on SSD instead

#### Hard Drives

I own one solid state drive (512GB) for my laptop. SSD's are probably the only thing that I will continue to spend money on.

#### Peripherals

I don't use anything fancy for my laptop. I find RGB too distracting. I own a B100 Logitech that does it's job well. I also do not have a mechanical keyboard.
